      <hr />
      <p>
        It doesn't take much to realize that the world is filled with <b>ignorance</b> and <b>indifference</b>.
        This is unsurprising for injustice and unfairness are usually only perceived if one is personally affected by them.
        Further, to engage in ethical thinking requires <b>intellectual skills</b> (e.g. critical, analytical, synthesising and problem-solving skills)
        and also <b>a certain character</b>, one that is free from vices such as cowardice, conformity, laziness and insensibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What to do?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        One answer might be that we should strive to bring out good character traits in our children and fellow human beings.
        In other words, to make them <b>virtuous</b> (e.g. couragous, fair, wise and reasonable).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b> Good luck with that.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Another answer, a better one I think, is <b>to trick society into adapting good habits and practices and abandoning bad habits and practices</b>.
        Of course, it would be better if we could transform society into a virtuous one.
        But how likely is that ever going to happen?
        Instead, tricking society into adapting good habits and practices 

        Even if you are an amazing, inspiring and exceptionally gifted teacher, you'll never reach 'em all and

        and, let's admit it, most people simply don't care about others and other living beings.

        That being said, <b>forget arguments and get creative</b>.


        When it comes to habits and practices, <b>reasons don't matter at all</b>.
        As soon as we trick society into adapting good habits and practices, <b>we don't need to waste time on education or enlightenment</b>.
        Let me illustrate this by an example:
      </p>
      <p>
        Switzerland is divided into several regions, called "Kantone".
        Some of them are located in mountainous regions and, because of their isolation and old-fashioned traditions, are sometimes seen as backward.
        During a class for my community service ("Zivildienst"), someone joked that people in these regions still eat dogs.
        Many of the participants laughed at that joke and I speculate that it was funny because it made fun of the alleged backwardness of the people who lived there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, eating dogs (and cats) is rather uncommon in Switzerland.
        But why is that so?
        People around the world eat all kinds of animals, so why should it be anything special to eat dogs?
        But for whatever reason people stopped eating dogs, eating dogs is now considered <b>not normal</b>.
        And here comes the beauty: As soon as we trick society into adapting good habits and practices, <b>we don't need to waste time on education and enlightenment</b>!
      </p>

        A good knife is one that cuts well.<br>
        A good tree is one that has strong roots.<br>
        A good tiger is one that is good at hunting.<br>
        But is there such a thing as a <b> good human</b>?

        If you have to use arguments, <b>you have already lost</b>.
        Ordinary People are <b>creatures of habit</b>.
        This means that ordinary people, <b>even if they accept an argument</b>, likely won't change their ways because doing so would require <b>work and a strong will</b>.
        Further, to properly consider an argument requires an <b>aspiration, a desire to know the truth</b>, which ordinary people often lack.
        Therefore, using arguments in order to deal with ordinary people is rather <b>pointless</b>.

        Two options come into mind:

            <b>Proper Upbringing and Education: </b> We educate our children and fellow human beings in a way that makes them <b>courageous, reasonable and virtuous</b>.
          </li>
          <li class="mb-3">
            <b>Influence Culture: </b> Change culture in a way that ordinary people in it are disposed to do right thing anyway.
          </li>
        </ul>
